# Perfume Shop Billing System

A simple and intuitive Python-based billing application tailored for perfume shops — designed to help shop owners manage sales, print bills/receipts, and keep track of transactions in an easy and efficient way.

## 🧾 Overview

Perfume Shop Billing System is a lightweight Point-of-Sale (POS) style application built in Python. It allows perfume shop owners (or small business retailers) to:  

- Add perfumes/products to a bill with quantity and unit price  
- Automatically calculate totals, taxes (if applicable), and grand total  
- Generate and print/display a bill/receipt for customers  
- (Optionally) Maintain a history or log of bills/transactions  

This project was developed as a simple desktop-based billing solution — ideal for small shops that want a quick and easy way to manage sales without relying on heavy or cloud-based POS software.

## 💡 Features

- Add multiple products with name, quantity, and price  
- Automatic calculation of total amount due  
- User-friendly console/GUI (depending on implementation) for quick billing  
- Easily extensible for additional features (like stock management, sales history, discounts)  
- Minimal dependencies — simple setup

### Why this structure matters  

- A good README helps others immediately understand *what the project is*, *why it exists*, and *how to get started* — which is essential, especially for open-source or shared projects. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- It organizes key information (installation, usage, features, future plans) so newcomers (or your future self) can quickly navigate the repo. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

If you like — I can also generate a **README template with badges, sample screenshots (if you have UI), and a full “To-do / Roadmap” section** — which tends to make a project more professional.  
Do you want me to build that for you now?
